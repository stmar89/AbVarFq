-Dieudonne Module of p-divisible group (this should be trivially the same)
-Location in Isogeny Graph (highlighted in graph)

Properties/Invariants:
-Dimension
-Isogeny Class
-dimension
-p-rank
-base field

Non-isogeny invariants:
-A[p]; p-torsion subgroup (these will all be the same for ordinary abelian varieties)
-a-number
-A(FF_{q^r}) group structure for r=1,2,3,...,g 
-Hasse-Witt Matrix
-Slope Filtration on Crystalline Cohomology 
-Neron Sevari group --- this is isomorphic to the group of polarizations. This group is Pic/Pic^0. 
-Picard Number, the rank of the Neron-Sevari group.

Improvements to Isogeny Classes:
-Cardinality of Isogeny Class
-Isogeny Graph (experiment to find the best way to display)
-Display Isomorphism Classes of Abelian Varieties with non-Gorenstein endomorphism algebras
-Neron Sevari group: 
-Picard Number: this is easy for powers of simples, rho(A^n) = e(A)*n(n+1)/2
