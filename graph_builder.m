1) Enumerate the lattice of orders between R=ZZ[F,V] and OK as a graph

2) For each S in Order, compute Weak Equivalence classes for S

3) For [S,T] adjacent in lattice with T above S, and each [IS,IT] pair 
of weak equivalence representatives, compute find minimal elements 
of (IS:IT)

4) Span by Picards. THIS STEP IS NOT IMPLEMENTS

WE ALSO NEED TO FIND ISOGENIES GOING BACKWARDS AND BETWEEN HORIZONTAL COMPONENTS. 
IT WOULD ALSO BE NICE TO SEE HOW DUALIZING AND THE FROBENIUS WORK IN THIS CONTEXT.
