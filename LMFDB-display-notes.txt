Questions:
-How much overlap do we want with isogeny class displays?

-Dieudonne Module of p-divisible group (this should be trivially the same)
-Location in Isogeny Graph (highlighted in graph)

Properties/Invariants:
-Dimension
-Isogeny Class
-dimension
-p-rank
-base field

Non-isogeny invariants:
-A[p]; p-torsion subgroup (these will all be the same for ordinary abelian varieties)
-a-number
-A(FF_q) group structure
